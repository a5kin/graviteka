Zepto-sage
Crawling out of vengeance.
Burning rage
Under falling quantum dust.
Zepto-sage
Spreading out his madness.
Turning pages
Burning under quantum lust.

---------------------------------

Because it's gravity, baby,
It wants you in grave.
All the collection of stars,
All the phenomena
It takes away.

It's gravity and it
Wants you in hell
Frozen to the heat death,
Ripped apart at the
Subatomic level.

---------------------------------

Now your turn,
Jump or die!
We accelerating to the
Speed of light.
