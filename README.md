# Graviteka
Synthwave project by Andrey Zamaraev, a complete reboot of the former [x-point](https://www.jamendo.com/artist/349326/x-point/albums) project.

This repository contains the sources for the upcoming debut album. As planned, the whole album could be re-created using only these sources. Also, GitHub Issues may be used for planning and GitHub Pages for the project website.

For those who are interested in how it may sound, there is a short demo called Wireframe Vision.
