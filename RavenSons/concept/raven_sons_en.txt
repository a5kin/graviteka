RAVEN SONS

I've logged in to the directory of my dreams,
Automatically saved by neuro-controller.
There my dreams are all shared out,
And most of them are about flowers.

I've logged in to my virtual garden,
Where synthetic apples on the branches are growing.
There my dreams are all reached out,
Genetically-algorithmic beauty of.

Robots who fell in love with the flowers,
Robots who fell in love with the flowers,
Robots who fell in love with the flowers,
Breed of Satan, raven sons.

(cyberOI!)

I've logged in to the implants black market,
Where all kinds of devices are cracked.
But implanting only flowers
Breed of Satan, raven sons.

Robots who fell in love with the flowers,
Robots who fell in love with the flowers,
Robots who fell in love with the flowers,
Breed of Satan, raven sons.

(solo)

I've logged in to the Technocultist temple,
Where all prayers are in binary assembling.
Flowers are sacrificed to the Matriarch,
More to synthesize in my lab.

Robots who fell in love with the flowers,
Robots who fell in love with the flowers,
Robots who fell in love with the flowers,
Breed of Satan, raven sons.

Robots who fell in love, robots who fell in love,
Robots who fell in love, robots who fell in love,
Robots who fell in love, robots who fell in love,
Robots who fell in love, robots who fell in love,
Robots...
