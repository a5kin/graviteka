Stars don't know who I am,
Because I'm too big for them.
They spending their lives
Surrounding in Dyson spheres.

I don't know who stars are,
They shine the way too far...

And slowly fading away,
Slowly fading away,
Still slowly fading away
To the state of decay.

Only darkness, there is no more stars
And just me rotating too fast.
Under polarized reality,
At the gates of immortality.

Ah, they are
They are finally free
Aha...
They all free
From this Universe' cruelty
And shine
Shine anew forever
Instantly.
